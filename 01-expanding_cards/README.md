Will update this file later on.

All right, so in this project, we're going to build some expanding cards, basically we were going, to style these panels to have a background image and a heading.

We're going to use flex blocks to align everything and then add a little bit of JavaScript so that when we click one of those, it changes the class to active and it then expands with the CSSs transition case.

We'll be using JavaScript for the event.
