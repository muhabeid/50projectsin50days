Will update this file later on.

In VS there's an Emet which is a tool that is pre-installed with VS Code that helps you write code faster. Mostly HTML codes.

# How to use Emet.... Simple examples
## - If you want to add class
(h1.myclass)
## - If you want to add two classes
(h1.myclass1.myclass2)

## - If you want to do an ID
(h1#myID)

## - If you want an ID and a class, you can combine the # and . together 
(h1#myID.myclass)

## - And if you we want to use a div for that, there is no need to write {div} 
(div.myclass) instead we can just use it like this (.myclass) (#myid) both ways works.

## - If we want to write more than one div, we can just casually introduce a multiplication sign
(div*n) - n in this case is the number we want to multiply
